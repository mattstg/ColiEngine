Things to Test for:
Inverser: X||Y start @ 0 && End ? || WORLD_SIZE_X
		  Y or X Is just One gaint Element
		  Y becomes full, needs to delete X
		  	at Start,Middle,End, Repeatdly


			split the namespaces
		  	
Find |ADDED THIS WHEN REALLY TIRED,NT SURE IF CORRECT|
in Node Manipulater


can add improper shaped sqaures to table, HashAdder Should do boundary checking

Finish MergeAllX, move it from hash to Nami
turn nami into an singleton

old code DeleteAllEmptyX was copied from needs to include this new cleanFunc

move retOverlap and compare to nami n overlap table
subset and overlap splitter also need to come over

To Increase runtime, remove instances of .CopyBoth

add to nami adding, sub nodes, getting last or first nodes etc
compare two node tables, with an offset applied to both S_XY
//

SUBTRACTOR STILL NOT WORKING
	Loop not entered for Y Sub in YSubtractor method


	apparently i was dumb,  AEO means A exists in O,  OEA means O exists in A, which is opp of convention


Main Node Has a Negative in it
omg regenerative levels
Last Node in Adder(30) has L,U = 0; Shouldnt it have been refined before? does 0,0 cause inf loop?

Frozen bug happens with -6-6, -1-1. Could be in the selecting of nodes, check if it adds weird


out of order
first node 37, second node broken (once 3rd node)

USING ENTITY OLD SET TO NODEW FUNCS WILL RPOB RETURN FALSE THINGS! FIX OR DNT USE

fix colitypes enum, find a trick

Dirt/Material?metal  ground sumthing object, comes with same params in Consts.Ground

_ColiWithGround in bodyMech is really buggy, also i seem to collide with stuff above me im not touching, is it possible the colision box is way off?

WHEN DISCONNECT A HASH TABLE CAN SPLIT :O INTO ANOTHER, MAKING CRUMBLING GROUND!! WHICH IF YOU MAKE MATERIAL OBJECT ABOVE MEANS CAN STORE ENERGY OR ACT ALL THE SAME ASSUMING ARE CONNECTED OMFG
